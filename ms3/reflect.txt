I really liked this project over previous classes as this one was much more step by step.

It was a great practice in OOP, that is the point of the course I guess. 
I didn't like that some member function said to be made without "const", means we can get some vulnerability, but this course is about programming, not security. 

The hardest part was MS1 as there were some stuff required for next MS and don't need right now, so I was confused about how it should work. Because of that, I had to come back to previous MS when I moved to the next one few times.

aside from that, the project was pretty easy, easier than the previous class, maybe just because we know programming better now.

the last thing I wanted to say - Thank you Cornel for the nice feedback about my first programs Because of your feedback I knew exactly what I should do next, other teachers don't do that, I would say you are the best from all I have seen in terms of teaching programming .
