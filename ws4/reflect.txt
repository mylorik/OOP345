In this workshop, I did not learn anything completely new. Just a practice how to read files, how to parse it into an object we will be using later on.
Also, like in the last workshop, this workshop teaches us to get used to rule of 5, creating create 5 functions: copy constructor, 
copy assignment operator, destructor, move constructor and move assignment operator.
