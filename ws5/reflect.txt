In this workshop I have practiced using lambada expression, more practice on working with files, try-catch and throw expression, templates and also prevent the copying, moving and assigning of an object.
Nothing from it was new to me, except preventing copying, moving and assigning, I hope I did it correctly as I am not sure that `=delete` works as I think.
The most important thing is practice working with files, it's pretty complicated process even though it looks like it's not.
