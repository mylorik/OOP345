The main thing I have learned is how to use templates, such a handy thing, we can use any data type using just a single, same function,
no need to overload it for every different type we may get.
All the logic is pretty much the same as usual, the only weird thing is that all the logic is actually inside the header file instead of the source file. 

I wasn't sure what is "the default constructor adopts a safe empty state" I am sick, so  I couldn't make to class even for a quiz, probably you did explain it there.
I have just created a regular "default constructor" with initiator "{} setting it to `0` " and a hope that this is correct, as we do not specify the constructor at all.
