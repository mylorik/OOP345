This week I learned a lot of math... I am bad and complicated math, even though I am making a complicated game right now (c#, if you are very interested, it's here https://github.com/mylorik/OctoGame/tree/master/OctoGame), so
I required a lot of help with formulas. In a programming perspective, I have learned that there is a "bug" where  "ifstream"  reads
one line twice if there is an empty line after it. I didn't really know how to fix it without counting lines at the beginning, so I would like to hear your feedback.

I learned a lot about vectors, to be precise - member functions, how many of them work like "accumulate", etc. A bit practice on working with templates and reading files. 
So, basically, a lot of math, STL's algorithms functions and practice in lambada expressions.
